# Turbowarp Mirror



## Why make a mirror?

Many schools and organizations block the original TurboWarp, with the reason given being for "games", even though most of the games playable there are hosted on Scratch, which is usually not blocked because there are classes offered that teach it and it's educational coding. TurboWarp is the same thing as the Scratch editor but way more advanced. It has many features and extensions that aren't available on Scratch.

## How to make your own TW mirror

If you have a GitHub account, it's easy to make your own mirror with a URL like: `username.github.io/mirror/`. You can even make one with a custom domain like mine if you know how to deploy a GitHub Pages site to a custom domain.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub. The name of the repository determines the path part of the mirror's URL.
3. Go to the "Settings" tab on your fork > Pages > set Source to GitHub Actions.
4. Go to the "Actions" tab on your fork > Enable actions > Deploy to GitHub Pages > Enable workflow.
5. Wait a few minutes and go back to the Pages settings. There will be a link to the live version of your mirror.

The mirror will update automatically around once a week. You can manually trigger updates if you go to Actions > Deploy to GitHub Pages > Run workflow > Run on `main`.
